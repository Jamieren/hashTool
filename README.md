# Hashing Tool Application

The Hashing Tool application is a user-friendly utility that allows you to quickly generate hash values for text input using a variety of popular hash algorithms. 

## Features

**User-Friendly Interface:** The application provides a clear and intuitive interface for entering the text to be hashed and selecting hash algorithms.

**Multiple Hash Algorithms:** Choose from a range of popular hash algorithms, including "md5", "sha1", "sha256", "sha224", "sha384","sha512", "blake2s", "blake2b", "sha3_256", "whirlpool".

**Interactive Algorithm Selection:** Customize hash generation by selecting algorithms based on your needs.

**Results Display:** Hashed results are presented in a separate window, making it easy to view and compare hash values. And it's copiable for user.

**Clear Instructions:** The application offers clear instructions on how to use the tool effectively.

**Layout Customization:** Customize the interface's appearance using the Tkinter GUI framework.


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Run the Application:** Execute the application by running `python hash_tool.py`.

3. **Input Text:** Enter the text you want to hash into the provided text entry field.

4. **Generate Hash:** Click the "Hash" button to initiate the hash generation process.

5. **Select Algorithms:** A dialog will appear, allowing you to select hash algorithms. Choose the desired algorithms and click "OK."

6. **View Results:** The hashed results will be displayed in a separate window.

## Limitations

**Limited Algorithm Choice:** While the application offers popular hash algorithms, it may not cover the entire range of cryptographic algorithms.

**No Salt or Key Support:** The application does not support adding salts or cryptographic keys for enhanced security.

**No Reverse Decoding:** The tool focuses solely on hash generation and does not include decoding functionality.

**Single-Platform:** Designed for desktop use and limited to platforms that support the Tkinter GUI library.

**Basic User Management:** The application does not include advanced user management or authentication features.
